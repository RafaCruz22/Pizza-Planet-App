# Pizza-Planet-App
Final project app for spring 2021


This project was for my Android Development class in 2021. In it I was tasked to work with 2 other class mates and design an app as our final project.
We decided to go with a Toy Story Theme Pizza shop. As a team we designed the look and feel of the app along with the menu. We used Firebase as our 
place to store the menu and the orders being placed by the user.
